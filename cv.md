## Personal information and work experience ##
I'm a student of Minsk State Linguistic University, currently I'm working as a receptionist in a medical lab.  
 I worked as a bibliographer, market analyst assistant, graphic designer(logo maker) and even a baby-sitter. These jobs are not connected to the sphere of IT, but they all helped me to develop soft skills such as communication, empathy, problem-solving skills, stress-resistance, time management. I'm a really curious person, I like to learn new things and gain experience. I'm sure this helps to become a good developer.
